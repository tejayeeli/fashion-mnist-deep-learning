Fashion MNIST Classification is a deep learning project that aims to classify grayscale images of clothing items into one of 10 categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project uses the Fashion MNIST dataset, a modern alternative to the traditional MNIST dataset, which includes images of apparel such as shirts, dresses, sneakers, and bags.

The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on a dataset of 60,000 training images and tested on 10,000 images. The images are 28x28 pixels in grayscale, making it ideal for image classification tasks with minimal preprocessing.
